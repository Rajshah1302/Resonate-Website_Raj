### Project Overview

**Resonate** is a platform currently under development, and this landing page serves as the **first touchpoint** for users. The goal of the landing page is to provide clear calls to action based on the user's app status. If the user has the app installed, they will be directed to the relevant rooms. If not, they will be shown a store listing for easy installation.
